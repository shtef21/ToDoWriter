Title:
ToDoWriter module


Description:
A PowerShell TODO app which enables its user to add TODO items, mark them as done / open and remove them.
Aside from that, it provides a ToDoWriter client which provides a basic UI and a session in which user may
add and manage many items at once.
Another useful behaviour regarding the module is putting the client script in the startup folder. That way,
each time the user starts the pc, they will see the TODO list. To enable this behaviour, you may check out
the instructions provided by the Set-ToDoClientStartup CMDLET.
